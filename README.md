## 💡 How It Works

1. Load PDFs from `data/`
2. Split text into chunks using `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`
3. Create vector embeddings with `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2`
4. Store vectors in FAISS
5. Ask questions via Streamlit interface
6. Query runs through LangChain `RetrievalQA` + Groq LLM
7. Returns accurate answers with document sources
