## 💡 How It Works

1. Load PDFs from `data/`
2. Split text into chunks using `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`
3. Create vector embeddings with `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2`
4. Store vectors in FAISS
5. Ask questions via Streamlit interface
6. Query runs through LangChain `RetrievalQA` + Groq LLM
7. Returns accurate answers with document sources


## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repo

git clone https://github.com/Bilal-codes05/medical-chatbot.git
cd medical-chatbot


### 2. Install Dependencies


pip install -r requirements.txt


or with Pipenv:


pipenv install

### 3. Setup Environment

Create a `.env` file in the root:


GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key


### 4. Generate Vector Store


pipenv run python vector_create.py


### 5. Run Streamlit App
pipenv run streamlit run medicalbot.py



## 🛡️ Notes

* **Your `.env` file is private**, never push it to GitHub.
* Ensure your PDF files are medically relevant and clean.
* You can switch the model or prompt template easily in code.
